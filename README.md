## Overview

The Docusaurus GraphView Plugin is an open source plugin designed to generate a graph view from your Docusaurus documentation files.
This visual representation helps in understanding the relationships between different documents, making navigation and comprehension easier.

### Built with

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [note-graph](https://github.com/hikerpig/note-graph)
- [Best README Template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template)

### Features

- Automatically generates a graph view from your documentation.
- Interactive and customizable graph visualization.
- Easy integration with your existing Docusaurus site.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these next steps.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Node, yarn and git installed.

### Installation

To install the plugin, you need to have Docusaurus set up. Follow these steps to add the GraphView plugin to your project:

1. Install the plugin via npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install docusaurus-graph
```

or

```sh
yarn add docusaurus-graph
```

2. Add the plugin to your Docusaurus site configuration (**docusaurus.config.js**):

```js
module.exports = {
  // Other Docusaurus configurations...
  plugins: ['docusaurus-graph'],
};
```

## Usage

Once the plugin is installed and configured, it will automatically generate a graph view of your documentation. You can access the graph view from a new button at the top right of your Docusaurus site.

### Configuration options

The plugin supports one option to get the path folder.

Example configuration:

```js
module.exports = {
  // Other Docusaurus configurations...
  plugins: [
    [
      'docusaurus-graph',
      {
         docsDir: "docs",
         buildDir: "build",
         sourcesTag: "sources",
         referencesTag: "references",
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

- `docsDir [default: docs]`: Specifies the path of the folder containing your documentation files.
- `buildDir [default: build]`: Specifies the path of the output build folder.
- `sourcesTag [default: sources]`: Specifies the sources tag name for .md files.
- `referencesTag [default: references]`: Specifies the references tag name for .md files.

### Markdown files

To create link between files, there are 2 tags :

#### Sources

Set the categories tag to a markdown file or a name. Example:

```md
## [comment]: <> (congratulations.md)

sidebar_position: 6
sources: tutorial-basics

---

# Congratulations!

You have just learned the **basics of Docusaurus** and made some changes to the **initial template**.

Docusaurus has **much more to offer**!
```

**Result :**

<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/CongratulationCategories.png" alt="graphview">
</p>

**To set multiple categories (or references) see this example :**

```md
## [comment]: <> (congratulations.md)

sidebar_position: 6
sources:

- intro
- tutorial-basics

---
```

#### References

Set the references tag to a markdown file or a name. Example:

```md
## [comment]: <> (congratulations.md)

sidebar_position: 6
references: tutorial-basics

---

# Congratulations!

You have just learned the **basics of Docusaurus** and made some changes to the **initial template**.

Docusaurus has **much more to offer**!
```

**Result :**

## How it works

The Docusaurus GraphView Plugin works by parsing your Docusaurus documentation files located in the specified `docsDir` and creating a visual graph representation based on the relationships between them. Here’s a high-level overview of the process:

- **File Parsing**: The plugin scans the documentation files in your specified folder (path) to identify references between documents.
- **Graph Construction**: Using the parsed data, the plugin constructs a graph data structure where nodes represent documents and edges represent references between them.
- **Graph Visualization**: The constructed graph is then rendered using a graph visualization library (such as note-graph (D3.js)), applying the configured layout and styles.
- **Interactive Elements**: The generated graph is interactive, allowing users to zoom in/out and drag nodes for better viewing.

> After the Docusaurus build process completes, the Docusaurus GraphView Plugin generates a data file containing the parsed documentation structure. This file, typically named `docusaurus-graph.json`, includes all the necessary information to construct the graph view, such as nodes (documents) and edges (links between documents).

## Development

If you want to contribute to the plugin or modify it for your own use, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Arsero/docusaurus-graph.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd docusaurus-graph
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

4. Make your changes and test them locally. To test them go to the `demo` folder.

```sh
cd demo
yarn install
yarn start
```

> The plugin is link to the `demo` project. The project is a simple docusaurus website with the plugin added.
